# ProvSec2024

The 18th International Conference on Provable and Practical Security.

Provable security is a critical tool for analyzing the security of modern cryptographic primitives in order to achieve high assurance of trustworthy and secure cyber systems. Provable security methodology contributed greatly to the analysis of cryptographic schemes and protocols, as well as their implementations in trusted and secure systems. However, cryptographic primitives without a rigorous "proof" cannot be regarded as sound. Security flaws in many cryptographic schemes and protocols once considered secure without formal analysis have been discovered using Provable Security methodology. Although Provable Security provides confidence in using cryptographic schemes and protocols for various real-world applications, schemes with Provable Security are sometimes not efficient enough for practical purposes, and it may be difficult to verify the correctness of the proofs.
